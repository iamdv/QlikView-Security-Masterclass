## Challenge Number 02

Use the **QlikView Security Masterclass zip** file which has the required QVW and the QVD files.

### Requirements:
=================
Following table is created using:

Dimension: Supplier Name
Measure: Sum([Order Amount])

![alt text](https://github.com/iamdv/QlikView-Security-Masterclass/blob/master/Assets/OrderAmount%20by%20Supplier.png "Order Amount by Supplier")

You need to a userid and password (test) for each supplier. So, suppliers can login with their respective and passwords to see the sales data. You should **NEVER** allow suppliers to view each other's sales information. This will be a security flaw!

**Implement Section Access using the USERID and PASSWORD (Not NTNAME). Feel free to use the INLINE load.**

**Make sure the administrator account [APPADMIN] has access to all the data**


**ALL-THE-BEST!**
